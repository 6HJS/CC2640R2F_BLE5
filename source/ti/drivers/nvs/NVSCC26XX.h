 *  @brief      Interrupt Latency During Flash Operations
 *
 *  When writing to or erasing flash, interrupts must be disabled to avoid
 *  executing code in flash while the flash is being reprogrammed. This
 *  constraint is met internally by the driver. User code does not need
 *  to safeguard against this.
 *
 *  Additionally, to avoid extremely large interrupt latencies that would be
 *  incurred if entire blocks were written with interrupts disabled, block
 *  writes to flash are broken into multiple smaller sizes.
 *
 *  Even with this scheme in place, latencies of roughly 64 microseconds will
 *  be incurred while flash is being written to.
 *
 *  A similar caveat applies to flash erase operations. Erasing an entire
 *  flash sector (the minimal amount that can be erased at a time) can take
 *  roughly 8 milliseconds. This entire operation must be performed with
 *  interrupts disabled. Here again, this requirement is met internally
 *  by the driver and flash region erases are performed one sector at a
 *  time to minimize this significant latency.impact.
 *
 *  Care must be taken by the user to not perform flash write or erase
 *  operations during latency critical phases of an application.

 *  @brief NVS function pointer table
 *
 *  'NVSCC26XX_fxnTable' is a fully populated function pointer table
 *  that can be referenced in the NVS_config[] array entries.
 *
 *  Users can minimize their application code size by providing their
 *  own custom NVS function pointer table that contains only those APIs
 *  used by the application.
 *
 *  An example of a custom NVS function table is shown below:
 *  @code
 *  //
 *  // Since the application does not use the
 *  // NVS_control(), NVS_lock(), and NVS_unlock() APIs,
 *  // these APIs are removed from the function
 *  // pointer table and replaced with NULL
 *  //
 *  const NVS_FxnTable myNVS_fxnTable = {
 *      NVSCC26XX_close,
 *      NULL,     // remove NVSCC26XX_control(),
 *      NVSCC26XX_erase,
 *      NVSCC26XX_getAttrs,
 *      NVSCC26XX_init,
 *      NULL,     // remove NVSCC26XX_lock(),
 *      NVSCC26XX_open,
 *      NVSCC26XX_read,
 *      NULL,     // remove NVSCC26XX_unlock(),
 *      NVSCC26XX_write
 *  };

 *  @brief      NVSCC26XX attributes
 *
 *  The 'regionBase' field must point to the base address of the region
 *  to be managed.
 *
 *  The regionSize must be an integer multiple of the flash sector size.
 *  For most CC26XX/CC13XX devices, the flash sector size is 4096 bytes.
 *  The NVSCC26XX driver will determine the device's actual sector size by
 *  reading internal system configuration registers.
 *
 *  Care must be taken to ensure that the linker does not unintentionally
 *  place application content (e.g., code/data) in the flash regions.
 *
 *  For CCS and IAR tools, defining and reserving flash memory regions can
 *  be done entirely within the Board.c file. For GCC, additional content is
 *  required in the application's linker command file to achieve the same
 *  result.
 *
 *  The example below defines a char array, 'flashBuf' and uses compiler
 *  CCS and IAR compiler pragmas to place 'flashBuf' at a specific address
 *  within the flash memory.
 *
 *  For GCC, the 'flashBuf' array is placed into a named linker section.
 *  Corresponding linker commands are added to the application's linker
 *  command file to place the section at a specific flash memory address.
 *  The section placement command is carefully chosen to only RESERVE space
 *  for the 'flashBuf' array, and not to actually initialize it during
 *  the application load process, thus preserving the content of flash.
 *
 *  The 'regionBase' fields of the two HWAttrs region instances
 *  are initialized to point to the base address of 'flashBuf' and to some
 *  offset from the base of the char array.
 *
 *  The linker command syntax is carefully chosen to only RESERVE space
 *  for the char array and not to actually initialize it during application
 *  load.
 *
 *  @code
 *  #define SECTORSIZE 0x1000
 *  #define FLASH_REGION_BASE 0x1b000
 *
 *  //
 *  // Reserve flash sectors for NVS driver use
 *  // by placing an uninitialized byte array
 *  // at the desired flash address.
 *  //
 *  #if defined(__TI_COMPILER_VERSION__)
 *
 *  //
 *  //  Place uninitialized array at FLASH_REGION_BASE
 *  //
 *  #pragma LOCATION(flashBuf, FLASH_REGION_BASE);
 *  #pragma NOINIT(flashBuf);

 *  //  The ,nvs section will be placed at address FLASH_REGION_BASE by
 *  //  the gcc linker cmd file.
 *  //
