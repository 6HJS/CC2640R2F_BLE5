## Example Summary

Application that writes to the UART and the available LCD display using Display
driver.

## Peripherals Exercised

* `Board_PIN_LED0` - Toggled by example task periodically
* `Board_UART` - (If enabled) Outputs test strings
* `Board_SPI ` - (If enabled) Outputs test strings to LCDs

## Resources & Jumper Settings

> If you're using an IDE (such as CCS or IAR), please refer to Board.html in
your project directory for resources used and board-specific jumper settings.
Otherwise, you can find Board.html in the directory
&lt;SDK_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/source/ti/boards/&lt;BOARD&gt;.

For convenience, a short summary is also shown below.

## Example Usage

* Run the example
* A splash screen will be displayed on LCD's and a welcome string on UART
* `Board_PIN_LED0` is toggled periodically
* The state of LED0 is output periodically on UART and LCD

## Application Design Details

* If the boosterpack is attached on the Launchpads, it will work out of the box.
* If not present, code can be disabled by adding the precompiler define
`BOARD_DISPLAY_EXCLUDE_LCD`.

> For SensorTags there is a pin conflict, so either the DEVPACK-DEBUG or the
DEVPACK-WATCH must be used and `BOARD_DISPLAY_EXCLUDE_UART` must be added to
the global precompiler defines in order to use LCD.

> For IAR users using any SensorTag(STK) Board, the XDS110 debugger must be
selected with the 4-wire JTAG connection within your projects' debugger
configuration.

TI-RTOS:

* When building in Code Composer Studio, the kernel configuration project will
be imported along with the example. The kernel configuration project is
referenced by the example, so it will be built first. The "release" kernel
configuration is the default project used. It has many debug features disabled.
These feature include assert checking, logging and runtime stack checks. For a
detailed difference between the "release" and "debug" kernel configurations and
how to switch between them, please refer to the SimpleLink MCU SDK User's
Guide. The "release" and "debug" kernel configuration projects can be found
under &lt;SDK_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/kernel/tirtos/builds/&lt;BOARD&gt;/(release|debug)/(ccs|gcc).

FreeRTOS:

* Please view the `FreeRTOSConfig.h` header file for example configuration
information.
