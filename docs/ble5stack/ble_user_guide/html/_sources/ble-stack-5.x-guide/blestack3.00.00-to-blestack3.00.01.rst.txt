BLE-Stack 3.00.00 to BLE-Stack 3.00.01
====================================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE-Stack 3.00.00 to
a BLE-Stack 3.00.01 project.

For this migration guide, simple\_peripheral from BLE-Stack 3.00.00 will be ported
over to BLE-Stack 3.00.01. Because the directory structure is nearly identical between the
two releases, the recommended approach is to start with a BLE-Stack 3.00.01 project that contains
the same base functionality as the porting target project and merge in any custom
functionality.

#. Choose a BLE-Stack 3.00.01 example project that contains your target project's base functionality.

    For reference, see available sample projects that start with simple\_

    In this example, we're going to use simple\_peripheral as the starting
    BLE-Stack 3.00.01 sample project.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE-Stack 3.00.00 into the BLE-Stack 3.00.01 example project.

    In this example, the following files from BLE-Stack 3.00.00 were moved into
    simple\_peripheral BLE-Stack 3.00.01 example:

    - ``simple_peripheral.c``
    - ``simple_peripheral.h``
    - ``simple_gatt_profile.c``
    - ``simple_gatt_profile.h``

    Modify ``main.c`` in the BLE-Stack 3.00.01 example if additional tasks
    were added in the BLE-Stack 3.00.00 project.

    .. attention::
        For applications using **Directed Advertisements** comment
        out ``#define GBM_GATT_NO_CLIENT`` in  ``gapbondmgr.c`` of BLE-Stack
        3.00.00 project to remain compliant with the |CORESPEC|.

        .. code-block:: c
            :linenos:
            :emphasize-lines: 3

            #ifdef GATT_NO_CLIENT
            #ifndef GBM_GATT_NO_CLIENT
            //#define GBM_GATT_NO_CLIENT // <-- Comment this out
            #endif // !GBM_GATT_NO_CLIENT
            #endif // GATT_NO_CLIENT

        See :ref:`creating-a-custom-ble-app_directed_advertisements` for more
        information.

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are supplied with the |SDK|.

    The following drivers have changed from BLE-Stack 3.00.00.
    Please see the changes to these drivers by comparing the supplied headers between those in
    simplelink_cc2640r2_sdk_1_00_00_2 and those in the |SDK|.

    - ``ADCCC26XX.h``
    - ``RF.h``

    Also, refer to the |TIRTOSUPGRADE| for additional information and the TI-RTOS examples included with |SDK|.

    For additional information on how BLE-Stack 3.00.01 uses TI-RTOS see
    :ref:`sec-tirtos-overview`

    For any utilized TI Drivers, review `TI-RTOS Kernel Users Guide`_ and
    `Driver APIs <..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/tidrivers\/tidriversAPIs.html>`__.
