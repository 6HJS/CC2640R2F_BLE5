BLE5-Stack 1.00.00 to BLE5-Stack 1.00.01
========================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE5-Stack 1.00.00 to
a BLE5-Stack 1.00.01 project.

For this migration guide, simple\_peripheral from BLE5-Stack 1.00.00 will be
ported over to BLE5-Stack 1.00.01. Because the directory structure is nearly
identical between the two releases, the recommended approach is to start with a
BLE5-Stack 1.00.01 project that contains the same base functionality as the
porting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE5-Stack 1.00.01 example project that contains your target project's base functionality.

    For reference, see available sample projects that start with simple\_

    In this example, we're going to use simple\_peripheral as the starting
    BLE5-Stack 1.00.01 sample project.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE5-Stack 1.00.00 into the BLE5-Stack 1.00.01 example project.

    In this example, the following files from BLE5-Stack 1.00.00 were moved into
    simple\_peripheral BLE5-Stack 1.00.01 example:

    - ``simple_peripheral.c``
    - ``simple_peripheral.h``
    - ``simple_gatt_profile.c``
    - ``simple_gatt_profile.h``

#. If your code contains any ``#ifdef USE_CORE_SDK``, remove these.

#. Modify ``main.c`` in the BLE5-Stack 1.00.01 example if additional tasks were added in the BLE5-Stack 1.00.00 project.

#. Please do not add any ``DV42_FEATURES`` defines to ``build_config.opt`` in BLE5-Stack 1.00.01. If you want to enable or disable :ref:`sec-secure-connections`, please use the :ble_api:`GAPBOND_SECURE_CONNECTION` parameter. (Secure Connections is enabled by default in BLE5-Stack 1.00.01.)

    .. code-block:: c

        uint8_t gapbondSecure = GAPBOND_SECURE_CONNECTION_NONE;
        GAPBondMgr_SetParameter(GAPBOND_SECURE_CONNECTION, sizeof(uint8_t), &gapbondSecure);

#. In BLE-Stack BLE5-Stack 1.00.01, heap management has been updated. Please see :ref:`dynamic_memory_allocation` for details on how to optimize your heap.

#. If you are using the GAPBondMgr, make sure a passcode callback function is defined and sent to the GAPBondMgr. This is mandatory in BLE5-Stack 1.00.01.

    .. code-block:: c

        // GAP Bond Manager Callbacks
        // These are set to NULL since they are not needed. The application
        // is set up to only perform justworks pairing.
        static gapBondCBs_t simpleBLEPeripheral_BondMgrCBs =
        {
            (pfnPasscodeCB_t) SimpleBLEPeripheral_passcodeCB, // Passcode callback
            SimpleBLEPeripheral_pairStateCB                   // Pairing / Bonding state Callback
        };

    The passcode can be defined as follows:

    .. code-block:: c

        /*********************************************************************
        * @fn      SimpleBLEPeripheral_passcodeCB
        *
        * @brief   Passcode callback.
        *
        * @return  none
        */
        static void SimpleBLEPeripheral_passcodeCB(uint8_t *deviceAddr, uint16_t connHandle, uint8_t uiInputs, uint8_t uiOutputs)
        {
            uint8_t *pData;

            // Allocate space for the passcode event.
            if ((pData = ICall_malloc(sizeof(uint8_t))))
            {
                *pData = uiOutputs;

                // Enqueue the event.
                SimpleBLEPeripheral_enqueueMsg(SBP_PASSCODE_NEEDED_EVT, 0, pData);
            }
        }

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are supplied with the |SDK|.

    The following drivers have changed from BLE5-Stack 1.00.00. Please see the
    changes to these drivers by comparing the supplied headers between those in
    simplelink_cc2640r2_sdk_1_30_00_25 and those in the |SDK|.

    - ``ADC``
    - ``NVS``
    - ``Display``

    .. attention:: The display folder should in BLE5-Stack 1.00.01 be included with the path ``<ti/display/Display.h>``, not ``<ti/mw/display/Display.h>``.

        .. code-block:: c

            #include <ti/display/Display.h>


#. Refer to the |TIRTOSUPGRADE| for additional information and the TI-RTOS examples included with |SDK|.
