External Interface
==================

The external interfaces include APIs and callbacks. Only the uGAP APIs are
exposed to the application. The application is responsible for registering
callbacks and handling them appropriately.

APIs
----

For complete listing of Micro BLE Stack APIs, see :ref:`micro_ble_api_reference`

Callbacks
---------

Callbacks are how the TI Micro BLE Stack communicates with the Application.
These callbacks are triggered at various events and will contain status
or payload depending on the role.

These callbacks should be defined by the Application and registered
by passing the structure of callbacks to the role's initialization
function.
