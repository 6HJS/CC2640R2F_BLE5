Creating a Voice Enabled Application
====================================

"Voice" in this section means "voice quality audio" or any sound with a similar
bandwidth. Voice can be compressed into a data stream that can easily be
transmitted over a low-bandwidth radio protocol. TI offers a voice solution based
on sampling a `Pulse Density Modulation (PDM) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation>`__
microphone.

This section aims to describe the firmware that implements the TI voice
solution. See the :ref:`tbl-sdk-ble-examples` in the SDK and the optional
Example Pack User's Guide on examples that demonstrate TI's voice solutions.

In addition to voice solution provided by the SDK, experimental development
is also being done on `TI's SimpleLink Github Page <https://github.com/ti-simplelink>`__
in the following areas:

- LaunchPad based voice receiver (`simple_central_audio_receiver`_ on the *ble_examples-2.2* branch)
    - Includes additional compression methods such as mSBC
    - External Codec support for line in/analog mic
- Voice over HID-over-GATT-Profile receiver Python script (`voice.py`_ on the *simplelink_sdk-1.40* branch)
    - Captures voice frames via HID reports

.. note::
    Currently the ``ble_examples`` repo contains sample applications in various
    development branches. Check back often for examples using other wireless
    technologies, or improvements to the BLE examples.
