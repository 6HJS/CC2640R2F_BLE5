Installing |BLESTACKVER|
========================

|BLESTACKVER| is a wireless component included as part of the |SDK|. All path
and file references in this document assume that the |SDK| is installed to the
default path (**<SDK\_INSTALL\_DIR>**).

TI recommends making a backup copy of the |SDK| before to making any changes.
|BLESTACKVER| uses paths relative to the |SDK| and therefore is portable in
respect to any valid installation path for the |SDK|.

.. attention::
    Code Composer Studio creates a *dynamic* installation variable for a
    discovered |SDK| instances. For more information, see
    :ref:`sec-inc-developing-in-ccs-discover-ccs-products`.

.. note::
    If installing the |SDK| to a non-default path, do not exceed the maximum
    length of the file system namepath. Actual paths may differ from the
    figures.

|SDK| also installs XDCTools if not already present. See the release
notes for required version numbers. Newer versions of tools may not be
compatible with this SDK release. Check the TI Bluetooth LE Wiki for the latest
supported tool versions.
