Sensor Controller
=================

The Sensor Controller (:term:`SC`) is an autonomous processor within the
|DEVICE|.

The Sensor Controller can control peripherals independently of the main CPU. For
example, the main CPU does not have to wake up to execute an ADC sample or poll
a digital sensor over SPI. This saves both current and wake-up time that would
otherwise be wasted. A PC tool lets you configure the Sensor Controller and
choose which peripherals are controlled and which conditions wake up the main
CPU. Sensor Controller Studio (:term:`SCS`) is a stand-alone IDE to develop
and compile microcode for execution on the Sensor Controller. Refer to Sensor
Controller Studio Help for more details and documentation on the Sensor
Controller.

#. Install the Sensor Controller Studio. Sensor Controller Studio can be
   downloaded from the following link:
   `Sensor Controller Studio <http://www.ti.com/tool/sensor-controller-studio>`_

#. Find documentation in Sensor Controller Studio by pressing **F1** or by going
