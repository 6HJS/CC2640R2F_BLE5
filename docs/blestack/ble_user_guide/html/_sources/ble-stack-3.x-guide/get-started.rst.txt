Getting Started
***************

.. important::

    For the latest User's Guide, see the `Online BLE-Stack User's Guide for Bluetooth 4.2`_.

This section serves as a road map for users developing applications
and products using the TI SimpleLink Bluetooth low energy |DEVICE|
wireless MCU platform. Whether a seasoned developer or just getting
started, TI has created a variety of resources to simplify
development on the |DEVICE| platform. These resources will enhance
your experience with the TI SimpleLink |BLESTACK| ™ |version| Software
Development Kit (SDK) from the out-of-the-box demo to production.

:numref:`fig_suggested_workflow` shows the suggested work flow for getting
started with TI's
SimpleLink Bluetooth low energy (BLE) development environment.

    Suggested Workflow

.. _get-started-demo:

Demo: Project Zero
==================

The |DEVICE| LaunchPad™ is the main development kit for Project Zero and
developing applications with the |BLESTACK|. To quickly get started on a
simple project with the |LP|, see the Project Zero overview page:
`www.ti.com/ble-project-zero <http://ti.com/ble-project-zero>`_.

Project Zero uses a modified version of the simple\_peripheral sample
application from this SDK to demonstrate and evaluate some of the most
commonly used BLE features. Using CCS Cloud™, TI's web based IDE, Project
Zero can be built, downloaded, and debugged directly from a supported browser
without the need to install a full desktop IDE. With Project Zero
running on the |DEVICE| LaunchPad, you can connect with your smart
phone to remotely blink on-board LEDs, send text strings to the
LaunchPad’s serial port, and receive button press notifications, all
right out of the box.

The following sections in this document focus on developing a custom
application with |BLESTACK|.

To summarize, Project Zero allows you to quickly:

-  Run software without installing any tools

-  Flash the device with a single-button click from the browser

-  Import a project to the cloud editor and develop, build, and debug

-  Download all required project files in one archive file for CCS
   Desktop development

    Demo: Project Zero
    ==================

    The |DEVICE| LaunchPad™ is the main development kit for developing applications
    with the |BLESTACK|. To quickly get started with the |LP|, see Project Zero on
    the TI SimpleLink GitHub :
    `TI SimpleLink GitHub for ble_examples 3.0 <https://github.com/ti-simplelink/ble_examples/tree/ble_examples-3.0>`_

    In order to run the Project Zero demo, you will need the |SDK| and CCS v7.1.
    If you have not done so already, follow the directions in Step 1. of the
    :ref:`get-started-develop` section. Next, you will need to follow the
    `Installation instructions <https://github.com/ti-simplelink/ble_examples/blob/ble_examples-3.0/README.md>`_
    on the TI SimpleLink GitHub page. For an in-depth guide on how to use Project Zero,
    see the Project Zero README.md on the the TI SimpleLink GitHub page.

    Project Zero uses a modified version of the simple\_peripheral sample
    application from this SDK to demonstrate and evaluate some of the most commonly
    used BLE features. With Project Zero running on the |LP|, you can
    connect with your smart phone to remotely toggle on-board LEDs, send text strings
    to the LaunchPad’s serial port, and receive button press notifications, without
    making any code modifications.

    To summarize, Project Zero allows you to quickly:

    -  Flash a demo project onto the |LP|

    -  Connect the |LP| to a smart phone or another central device

    -  Control LEDs and send messages over UART

    The following sections in this document focus on developing a custom
    application with |BLESTACK|. When developing a new application for the
    |LP|, we recommend starting from simple\_peripheral instead of Project Zero
    due to flash optimizations.

    After you have become familiar with Project Zero, if you want additional training
    continue on to the :ref:`get-started-learn` track. If you are an advanced developer
    and are ready to get started with developing your own application, continue on
    to the :ref:`get-started-develop` track.

.. _get-started-learn:

Learn
=====

Resources contained in the Learn track of :numref:`fig_suggested_workflow` are
intended for users who are new to BLE or TI-RTOS. These modules demonstrate how
to create custom applications with |BLESTACK| and TI's Real Time Operation
System (TI-RTOS).

-  **SimpleLink Academy** `http://dev.ti.com/CC2640R2F-SimpleLink-Academy <http://dev.ti.com/tirex/#/?link=Software%2FSimpleLink%20CC2640R2%20SDK%2FSimpleLink%20Academy%2FOverview>`_

SimpleLink Academy provides a comprehensive set of training tools that allow
users from beginners to experienced developers to learn about the SimpleLink MCU
Platform.

Using introductory material and labs, learn the fundamentals of
BLE and how to develop a custom BLE profile.

SimpleLink Academy also contains modules written to demonstrate the rich debug
environment and peripheral driver capability provided by TI-RTOS.

-  **TI-RTOS Kernel Workshop** `www.training.ti.com/ti-rtos-kernel-workshop <http://training.ti.com/ti-rtos-kernel-workshop>`_

This material teaches users who are new to TI-RTOS or any RTOS
programming in general about TI’s RTOS kernel implementation.

Modules within the kernel training greatly expand the information
presented in the :ref:`sec-tirtos-overview` chapter.

Learn how the TI-RTOS provides the most optimal power management
and design flexibly.

.. _get-started-develop:

Develop
=======

The develop track of :numref:`fig_suggested_workflow` is intended for
programmers who are ready to start developing an end product using the |DEVICE|.
To begin:

1. **Download the SimpleLink CC2640R2 SDK** `http://www.ti.com/tool/SIMPLELINK-CC2640R2-SDK <http://www.ti.com/tool/SIMPLELINK-CC2640R2-SDK>`_

|BLESTACK| contains the code necessary to create a complete Bluetooth low energy
end application. The stack library implements the BLE protocol stack on the
|DEVICE|, and the various example projects use the stack library to implement
end devices. These examples should be considered as starting points for end
product designs.

To install the |BLESTACK|, run the
**simplelink\_cc2640r2\_sdk\_M\_mm\_pp\_bb.exe** installer.

-  The default SDK install path is
   C:\\ti\\simplelink\_cc2640r2\_sdk\_M\_mm\_pp\_bb\. Throughout the rest of
   this document, this path will be referred to as <SDK\_INSTALL\_DIR>.

   See :ref:`sec-ble-stack-install` for help installing the |SDK|.


2.  **Get Familiar with the BLE-Stack User's Guide for Bluetooth 4.2**

This User's Guide is meant to be used alongside the |BLESTACK|
when developing an end product. It contains documentation on the stack
architecture, APIs, and suggestions for developing applications. To jump to the
Table of Contents, click here:  :ref:`sdg-overview`

.. important::

    For the latest User's Guide, see the `Online BLE-Stack User's Guide for Bluetooth 4.2`_.

3. **Select an Example Project**

The |BLESTACK| includes a basic set of projects to use as a starting point for
development of your custom application. TI recommends that users start their
development on a project starting with ``simple_``. Click the links below to find

4. **Begin Development with an IDE**

An Integrated Development Environment can be set up to make it easier to browse
through the
relevant projects and view code. All embedded software for the |DEVICE| is
developed using either TI's Code Composer Studio or IAR's Embedded Workbench for
ARM (from IAR Systems) on a Windows 7\ :sup:`®` or later PC.
