Troubleshooting Guide
---------------------

This guide seeks to address many of the common issues encountered during OAD.

General Troubleshooting Guide Prior to :term:`BIM`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are various places where OAD can fail; use the following steps to
determine where the issue is occurring during the interaction:

-  Use a BLE Packet Sniffer and Record the OAD Transaction

   This will verify that the profile is implemented correctly and a
   valid image was transferred over the air.

      -  Look for a OAD Initiation

         Notifications from OAD Image Notify should be requested – and the
         appropriate response from the :term:`OAD Target` after a GATT Write of
         the Candidate metadata.

      -  Look for OAD Image Status Characteristic

         This will contain the status of the image prior to :term:`BIM` launching
         the image.

-  Read external/internal flash to ensure CRC Shadow is valid and
   matches CRC field

   - This will verify that the image was received fully without errors by
     the OAD Target

      -  For Internal, various tools can be used. SmartRF Programmer 2 or
         using a jtag debugger and connecting to running target and
         utilizing a memory viewer are possible options.

      -  For External, interface another MCU or another serial device to
         dump out the Flash.

Downloaded OAD Image Isn’t Starting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the application doesn’t start running the downloaded firmware after a
successful download, it’s a :term:`BIM` issue.

Depending on OAD type, on-chip or off-chip, refer to sections
:ref:`sect-bim-for-on-chip-oad` or :ref:`sect-bim-for-off-chip-oad`
respectively. Utilize how :term:`BIM` operates and a debugger to find where the
issue is occurring.

Should External Flash be Used During OAD?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No, External flash should not be utilized while OAD Profile is active;
the Profile is designed to have uninterrupted exclusive access to Flash, in
Off-Chip configurations.

Building Super Hex Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build merged hexfiles, there are various methods to do this. One
option is to utilize the TI OAD Image Tool (Python). See
:ref:`sec-generating-production-image` for more information.
Hex files can be converted to binary using any tool that supports the Intel
extended hex format.

Using Cache as RAM with OAD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For genereal directions on using the cache as RAM, see :any:`section-cache-as-ram`.

To use the cache as RAM, the BIM project linker command file (``cc26xx_bim_r2.cmd`` or
``cc26xx_bim_r2.icf``) must be configured. Follow the instructions in
:ref:`section-cache-as-ram`.

Mobile Application Can’t Perform OAD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ensure the latest version of the Application is downloaded from your
Phone’s Application Store and try again.

If problem persists, please post your Phone’s Model and OS Version
number along with details to reproduce your setup on our Support Forums.
Utilize BTool and verify that the OAD works correctly.

OAD Target device doesn't reset after successful OAD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IThis usually occurs when the JTAG debugger (e.g., XDS110) is connected.
Disconnect and remove the debugger prior to performing OAD.

This issue should not be appearing in field devices, or devices
that are powered through a battery or other means.

Can't connect via BTool After successful OAD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Try resetting the :code:`host_test` device attached to BTool.
- Close and re-open BTool.
- Verify target is advertising using a mobile app.

:term:`OAD Target` App Doesn't Advertise out of the Box
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Likely the image metadata is not embedded in the image, or there is a corrupted
image that is causing problems.

- Perform a forced mass erase using Smart RF Flash Programmer 2
- Follow the steps at :ref:`sect-on-chip-demo`, particularly
  :ref:`sec-generating-production-image`
