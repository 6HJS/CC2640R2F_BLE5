Over the Air Download (OAD)
===========================

This section serves as a guide to the Texas Instruments Over-the-Air Download
(:term:`OAD`) ecosystem including the custom profile specification, application
architecture, drivers, and middleware. :term:`OAD` is a device firmware upgrade
method that allows the firmware image running on a device to be updated
over the air using a Bluetooth low energy connection while providing power loss
protection.

The guide will cover the principles of the :term:`OAD` process, the out of
the box examples included in the |SDK|, and the process for adding :term:`OAD`
to an existing project.

.. warning::

    Updating the device firmware over serial (UART or SPI) connection from a
    host MCU using the CC26xx embedded ROM Serial Bootloader (SBL) is covered in
    application note CC2538/CC26xx Bootloader Interface (SWRA466).


The :term:`OAD` guide section will cover:

    - :term:`OAD` theory of operation and architecture
    - How to run the :term:`OAD` examples included in the |SDK|
    - How to add :term:`OAD` to an existing sample application

The supported development kit for :term:`OAD` is the |LP|. To follow the
procedures listed in this guide, two |LP| development kits are required.
